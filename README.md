This website, dedicated to Herbal, Lymphatic drainage, and Zone therapy, is a static yet responsive front-end project. It was developed as part of the Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development Course for educational reasons. Crafted with HTML and CSS, the website aims at a seamless and user-friendly interface.  It highlights my interest for these therapeutic methods as a means of achieving body balance and wellness. This project serves as the first step in my path to mastering both front-end and back-end development, aiming to create an online space that is informative, easy to use, and effectively showcases these therapeutic services.

## Design

I chose to use a colour scheme that is down-to-earth to evoke calmness and professionalism. I ensured good contrast for readability, especially between text and background colors.
I used colour sparingly to highlight key areas like headings or important features.

### Colour Scheme

Soft blues, greens, and neutral brown/beige hues are often associated with health and wellness.
I've used:
* #301301 and #fdf8f5 as primary color for body, heading and paragraph.
* #800000 for highlighting headings and buttons
* #ded9db for header and footer background.
* #0000ff as hover effect on buttons, links and giftcard images.
* #503429, 
* #dbd3d0, 
* #e1dad7
* #fdf8f5
* #ffffff as effect on buttons when hovering

### Typography

* Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site. I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as it doesn't require you to download the font.
* I've included all weights to have the possibility of variation.
* My choice was based on readability and that I find the fonts to convey a neutral, easy to read feeling.
* [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text=Manus%20Herba%20-%20Herbal,%20Lymphatic%20drainage%20and%20Zone%20therapy%20website=roboto) for headings H1-H6 & paragraph.
* [Open sans](https://fonts.google.com/?preview.text=Manus%20Herba%20-%20Herbal,%20Lymphatic%20drainage%20and%20Zone%20therapy%20website&query=Open+sans) for body text.

## Structure & Features

The site has a simple structure made up of 7 pages plus 3 additional subpages.

  --   Insert IMAGE per Feature  --

* Home page / landing page - A short introduction to the therapy types with call to action buttons.
* Therapy content page - Exploring all the therapy forms, short blurb of what to expect.
* Shop - A page where I offer to purchase gift cards.
* Contact -  A page where one can book the either type of therapy and or leave feed-back.
* Privacy policy - Outlines data handling, user rights, and privacy practices on website.
* Cookies - Details website's use of cookies and user consent requirements.
* There are also two additional subpages:
  * GDPR
  * A thank you page for when a user has submitted a form.
  * A 404 page for when user land on a non-existent page.

### General features on each page

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* a favicon in the browser tab
* fixed navbar at the top for desktop and tablet users, enabling easy navigation to any section at any time – ideal for returning visitors familiar with the layout. On mobile devices, the navbar scrolls with the page to optimize screen space and enhance user experience.
* Additionally, every page includes a footer with links to the enteprise's social media, ensuring constant connectivity and engagement. 
* The website includes payment links that will provide convenient and secure transaction options in future versions when it becomes 'shopified.'

### Future Implemantations
Possible future implemantaions would be to 'shopify' the site, with all that comes with that. Smaller steps on the way are:
* A booking form with calendar
* A separate feedback form
* A search function
* Possibility to bookmark ones favourites
* An FAQ page
* A chat-bot
* A check-out procedure

### Accessibility

While developing the website, I've carefully focused on maximizing its accessibility. This goal was achieved through the following methods:

* [Wave Web Accessibility Evaulation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)
  * Using semantic HTML.
  * Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
  * Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
  * Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

### HTML validation

* *Add screenshot of HTML checker result per page*

### CSS Validation

* *Add screenshot of HTML checker result per page*

### Accessibility
* I ran the site through the Wave Web Accessibility Evaulation Tool. The tool did not raise specific isssues, it pointed att good practice. 
  * Though after the the test I did make the buttons larger and chose a darker color for the fa-brands icons in the footer.
  * I also changed the link colour to blue when hovered upon, blue is often a good choice as it is generally distinguishable by people with various forms of color blindness.

### Performance
* *I ran the site through Google Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse to check on its performance. List whatever findings, rememeber to add screenshots of the lighthouse result*.

### Responsiveness
* Tested on Galaxy S20, Iphone Pro 13, 27" Samsung screen, 24" Imac.

## Credits

### Code used

### Code Used

* I encountered a challenge with styling an active menu item. Initially, using a class active selector with border-bottom resulted in a line that was wider than desired. To resolve this, I sought advice on Slack and supplemented it by researching pseudo-elements on W3Schools and MDN, and through experimentation. This process led to a solution, further inspired by a specific Stack Overflow discussion related to creating a vertical line for active menu items [found here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68834109/how-do-i-get-a-vertical-line-to-the-left-of-the-active-menu-item)

* I sought a straightforward method to enhance the footer and header and discovered an approach for creating rounded corners. This technique, inspired by an example from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp) involves using CSS3 properties for borders. This has effectively given a more polished look to these website sections.

* I wanted to highlight the giftcard images in shop with something more than scaling effect up hover. Added dropshadow when hovering, amended from [mdn web doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/drop-shadow).

* [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/): Used to create the site Favicon and provided the code in the head of all pages.

* [Privacy Policy Generator](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/): Used to create content in [Privacy Policy page](https://jaqikal.github.io/wellness-therapy/privacy-policy).
