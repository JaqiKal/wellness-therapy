This website, dedicated to Herbal, Lymphatic drainage, and Zone therapy, is a static yet responsive front-end project. It was developed as part of the Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development Course for educational reasons. Crafted with HTML and CSS, the website aims at a seamless and user-friendly interface.  It highlights my interest for these therapeutic methods as a means of achieving body balance and wellness. This project serves as the first step in my path to mastering both front-end and back-end development, aiming to create an online space that is informative, easy to use, and effectively showcases these therapeutic services.

## Design

I chose to use a colour scheme that is down-to-earth to evoke calmness and professionalism. I ensured good contrast for readability, especially between text and background colors.

I used colour sparingly to highlight key areas like headings or important features.

### Colour Scheme

I wanted down to earth hues, calm, soft and non intrusive ambiance. The palette I chose combines grounding, earthy tones with soft, calming neutrals. I believe that this combination is well-suited for a website in the wellness and therapy domain, as it can create a tranquil and inviting space that encourages visitors to explore and learn more about the natural treatments I offer.

| Hex Colour | Use | Objectives |
| ---| --- | --- |
| #800000 | To highlight headings and buttons | A deep, rich color suggesting sophistication and earthiness. It's grounding and can evoke a sense of balance and stability, which is fitting for a website focused on natural  therapies.|
| #231005 | Footer icons and links |  A very dark brown, almost black, is reminiscent of the earth and soil. It's a strong, foundational color that can convey a sense of seriousness and depth.|
| #301301 | Heading and paragraph | Similar to maroon but with a deeper tone, burgundy adds a touch of elegance and warmth, reinforcing a nurturing and comforting atmosphere. |
| #503429 | Background-color for table data cells and for lines in form | This is a warm, welcoming brown. It's softer and less intense than the darker browns, helping to balance the palette with a more approachable feel.|
| #b7a8a2 | Header and footer background | A neutral, gentle color that harmonizes the palette. It's unobtrusive and soothing, and in my opinion making it ideal for backgrounds or to soften the overall look of the website. |
| #e1dad7 | Background colour table heading, outline toggle box ridge |soft, warm off-white adds lightness and a sense of calm. It's less stark than pure white, which helps maintain the down-to-earth vibe. |
| #fdf8f5 | Generic background color |This is almost white with a hint of warmth. It's inviting and comforting, perfect for creating a sense of openness and light without being too clinical. |
| #ffffff | As effect on button text when hovering |Pure white is great for clarity and cleanliness. It provides a neutral background that can make other colors stand out and is essential for text readability. |
| #0000ff | As hover effect on buttons, links and giftcard images. | A good colour for accessibility purpose. |

### Typography

* Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site. I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as it doesn't require you to download the font.
* I've included all font weights to have the possibility of variation.
* My choice was based on readability and that I find the fonts to convey a neutral, easy to read feeling.

* H1-H6 & paragraph:
 [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text=Manus%20Herba%20-%20Herbal,%20Lymphatic%20drainage%20and%20Zone%20therapy%20website=roboto)

### Future Implementations

Possible future implementations would be to 'shopify' the site, with all that comes with that. Smaller steps on the way are:

* A booking form with calendar
* A separate feedback form
* A search function
* Possibility to bookmark ones favourites
* An FAQ page
* A chat-bot
* A check-out procedure

### Accessibility

While developing the website, I've carefully focused on maximizing its accessibility. This goal was achieved through the following methods:

* [Wave Web Accessibility Evaulation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)
  * Using semantic HTML.
  * Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
  * Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
  * Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
  * I changed the link colour to blue when hovered upon, blue is often a good choice as it is generally distinguishable by people with various forms of color blindness.
  * I made the buttons larger and chose a darker color for the fa-brands icons in the footer.

## Credits

### Code Used

* I encountered a challenge with styling an active menu item. Initially, using a class active selector with border-bottom resulted in a line that was wider than desired. To resolve this, I sought advice on Slack and supplemented it by researching pseudo-elements on W3Schools and MDN, and through experimentation. This process led to a solution, further inspired by a specific Stack Overflow discussion related to creating a vertical line for active menu items [found here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68834109/how-do-i-get-a-vertical-line-to-the-left-of-the-active-menu-item)

* I sought a straightforward method to enhance the footer and header and discovered an approach for creating rounded corners. This technique, inspired by an example from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp) involves using CSS3 properties for borders. This has effectively given a more polished look to these website sections.

* To not letting the user to be able to put whitespace at the beginning/end of a textinput I found a code snippet at [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13766015/is-it-possible-to-configure-a-required-field-to-ignore-white-space), unforunately it doesn't work as intended.

* I wanted to highlight the giftcard images in shop with something more than scaling effect upon hover. Added dropshadow when hovering, amended from [mdn web doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/drop-shadow).

* [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/): Used to create the site Favicon and provided the code in the head of all pages.

* [Privacy Policy Generator](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/): Used to create content in [Privacy Policy page](https://jaqikal.github.io/wellness-therapy/privacy-policy).
