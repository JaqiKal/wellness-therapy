This website, focused on lymphatic drainage and zone therapy, is a static, responsive front-end site created for educational purposes as part of the Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development Course. It's crafted using [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) to offer a smooth, user-friendly experience. The site serves as a showcase for services in zone therapy and lymphatic drainage therapy, blending my enthusiasm for therapy with my web development skills. The goal is to establish an online platform that is both informative and easy to navigate, promoting my therapeutic services effectively.

## Design

I chose to use a colour scheme that evokes calmness and professionalism. I ensured good contrast for readability, especially between text and background colors.
I used colour sparingly to highlight key areas like headings or important features.

### Colour Scheme

Soft blues, greens, and neutrals are often associated with health and wellness.

### Typography

*To de decided and added!*

* *Choose fonts.*

* *Why did you choose the font you have?*
  * I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as it doesn't require you to download the font.

* *Is this an accessibly friendly font?*

* *What weights have you included?*

* *Include an image of the fonts chosen as a reference.*

### Imagery

Images used on this website have been sourced from free online resources, either generated by AI technology or obtained from Wikimedia Commons. Each image has been carefully selected to enhance the content and provide a visually engaging experience for our visitors.

### Wireframes

*To be added!*

## Structure & Features

The site has a simple structure made up of 7 pages plus 2 additional subpages.

* Home page / landing page - A short introduction to the therapy types with call to action buttons.
* Zone Therapy content page - Exploring Zone Therapy: Techniques, Benefits, and Holistic Wellness Information
* Lymphatic drainage therapy content page - Exploring Zone Therapy: Techniques, Benefits, and Holistic Wellness Information
* Shop - A page where I offer to purchase gift cards.
* Booking form -  A page where one can book the either type of therapy.
* Privacy policy - Outlines data handling, user rights, and privacy practices on website.

* There are also two additional subpages:
  * A thank you page for when a user has submitted a form.
  * A 404 page for when user land on a non-existent peage.

### General features on each page

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* *Elaborate*

* a favicon in the browser tab
* a Hero image, which is designed to be responsive, adapting its text, layout, and gradient for various screen sizes and orientations, both in portrait and landscape modes, to ensure readability and visual appeal.
* fixed navbar at the top for desktop and tablet users, enabling easy navigation to any section at any time – ideal for returning visitors familiar with the layout. On mobile devices, the navbar scrolls with the page to optimize screen space and enhance user experience.
* Additionally, every page includes a footer with links to the enteprise's social media, ensuring constant connectivity and engagement.

### Future Implemantations

### Accessibility

While developing the website, I've carefully focused on maximizing its accessibility. This goal was achieved through the following methods:

* [Wave Web Accessibility Evaulation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)
* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
